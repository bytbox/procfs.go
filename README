Procfs.go allows you to interface (read-only) with procfs from go programs. The
simplest usage is to create a ProcFS object and call the Fill() method:

  var pfs procfs.ProcFS
  pfs.Fill()

This can be somewhat slow (50ms on a 2GHz processor), so if you only want a
certain part of the structure, you can ask just for that

  pfs.Get(PROCFS_MOUNTS) // get the list of mounts in pfs.Mounts
  pfs.List(PROCFS_PROCESSES) // fill in stub processes in pfs.Processes
  pfs.Get(PROCFS_SELF) // find our process id
  pfs.Processes[pfs.Self].Fill() // fill in all information for our own process

Procfs.go is goinstallable with

  goinstall github.com/bytbox/procfs.go/procfs

A jsonrpc daemon is also provided in procd, providing a network frontend to
procfs.
